How do I know which middleware is suitable?

Think of middleware as pluggable layers between client and server. The kind you use depends on your project type (website, API, SaaS, etc.) and requirements.

✅ Common Middleware Use Cases (most projects need these)

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

Needed if your frontend (e.g., React/Next.js) runs on a different domain/port than your API.

Example: http://localhost:3000 (Next.js) calling http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI).

FastAPI already has CORSMiddleware built-in.

Logging & Monitoring

Track request time, IP, user agent, etc.

Useful in production to debug slow APIs.

Authentication/Authorization

Check if the request contains valid tokens (JWT, OAuth2, API keys).

Usually middleware intercepts and rejects invalid requests.

Error Handling / Custom Responses

Convert unhandled exceptions into a standard JSON format.

🛠️ FastAPI built-in vs custom

FastAPI built-in middlewares (like CORSMiddleware) are enough 90% of the time.

Custom middleware is needed when:

You want special logic (e.g., logging to a database, enforcing per-user rate limits).

Your project has specific compliance needs (banking, healthcare, etc.).

You want to replace/extend built-in features.

🔹 Real Developer Talk

In teams, engineers usually say things like:

“We need to add CORS middleware so frontend can hit the API.”

“Let’s add a request logger to catch performance bottlenecks.”

“Auth middleware should reject any request without a valid JWT.”

👉 For your course project (API + frontend Next.js + Docker):

You’ll definitely need CORS.

You’ll definitely need logging.

You’ll probably add auth middleware when you build login/LLM parts.
