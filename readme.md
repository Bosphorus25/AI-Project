understanding how a flow of request from client side from a website happen and fulfill request
https://chatgpt.com/
this is a link which consist of many parts 
1- https: this means hyper text transfer protocol s for secure connection
2- chatgpt.com is a name of ip address from domain name system dns let's say its ip is 167.511.0.1
3- next part is ports ports are like workstations in a computer maximum 65535 different type of applications work on specific type of ports but one at a time in this url port number is hiden let's us say 8000. At this point this is called base url.
4- now here come routes when a request goes to specific ip address at their port then fast api determine which function need to call by matching route names https://chatgpt.com/c here c is the route or function that need to be called.https://chatgpt.com/ only / at the end means start point home of the application.
5- one more hiden thing is the request method fastapi check which method in request is. 
6- base on the request required function is called and response is send back.


Understanding ports in detail:

A port is like a door (or workstation, as you said) on a computer.

Each port is identified by a number (0â€“65535).

An IP address is like the street address of a building, and the port is like the door number inside that building.

For example:

If you go to 192.168.1.10:80 â†’ youâ€™re entering the house at address 192.168.1.10, door 80, which is usually for HTTP (web traffic).

If you go to 192.168.1.10:22 â†’ same house, but now you enter through door 22, which is usually for SSH (remote login).

ðŸ‘‰ Important points:

A port can only be used by one application at a time. For example, if one web server is already listening on port 8000, another canâ€™t use the same port on that machine unless the first one is stopped.

Different applications use different ports to separate traffic (like workstations handling different tasks).

Some ports are well-known:

80 â†’ HTTP

443 â†’ HTTPS

22 â†’ SSH

25 â†’ SMTP (email)

So in our case, when you run FastAPI with uvicorn main:app --reload, it starts listening on port 8000 by default. Thatâ€™s why you open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in the browser to talk to your API.

Making setup of sql database alembic models and configuration

learning sql type postgresql our db cloud provider is neon.tech

to learn and understand our database from ui use TablePlus dosen't matter which cloud or nosql db type we are using paste db uri in Tableplus to make connection.

to setup whole project make a folder structure.

add these libraries 
poetry add sqlalchemy     a library used to make schema perform sqlalchemy methods that             postgress understand and to perform CRUD

poetry add alembic          (it is a package a collection of modules organized in a directory
                            A collection of modules organized in a directory. It often includes an __init__.py file to indicate it is a package.)                
poetry add psycopg2-binary

alembic is used to make schema of table in db

to setup alembic run this command a new "alembic" folder and "alembic.ini" file is auto generated with it

poetry run alembic init alembic

to connect db with alembic paste db uri in env.py # overwrite sqlalchemy.url in alembic.ini
config.set_main_option("sqlalchemy.url", DATABASE_URL)

now create a file.py to make models every new table that is formed is called model in model we define schema of a table



every time we make changes in youtube_model a new copy of model is saved in alembic.version

make a class model as Youtube in which we define python class for table youtube

import required modules

from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Boolean, DateTime           to define table schema
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

In SQLAlchemy, declarative base is a factory function that creates a base class for your database models. This base class provides the foundation for defining your tables and their relationships in an object-oriented way.Instead of writing raw SQL to create tables, you define Python classes that represent your tables, and SQLAlchemy takes care of translating those classes into SQL statements.

after creating a class model make a connection between alembic and models

import Base in alembic.env from folder.file eg"from models.youtube_model import Base" and change target_metadata = Base.metadata

Running Migrations
Whenever you make changes to your models, run the following command this makes a copy of file in versions with new changes

poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "any name here you want for your changes"

till now no changes appear in db the changes appear only in versions 

to apply migrations on db run following command

poetry run alembic upgrade head

now the process to make and manage schema through alembic ended

our next step is to apply crud on db from fastapi

before applying crud make a folder config and a file database.py in config to make a connection between db and fastapi 

import create_engine and session maker from sqlalchemy 

connect engine with db_uri and bind engine in sessionmaker
