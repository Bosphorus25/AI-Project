understanding how a flow of request from client side from a website happen and fulfill request
https://chatgpt.com/
this is a link which consist of many parts 
1- https: this means hyper text transfer protocol s for secure connection
2- chatgpt.com is a name of ip address from domain name system dns let's say its ip is 167.511.0.1
3- next part is ports ports are like workstations in a computer maximum 65535 different type of applications work on specific type of ports but one at a time in this url port number is hiden let's us say 8000. At this point this is called base url.
4- now here come routes when a request goes to specific ip address at their port then fast api determine which function need to call by matching route names https://chatgpt.com/c here c is the route or function that need to be called.https://chatgpt.com/ only / at the end means start point home of the application.
5- one more hiden thing is the request method fastapi check which method in request is. 
6- base on the request required function is called and response is send back.


Understanding ports in detail:

A port is like a door (or workstation, as you said) on a computer.

Each port is identified by a number (0â€“65535).

An IP address is like the street address of a building, and the port is like the door number inside that building.

For example:

If you go to 192.168.1.10:80 â†’ youâ€™re entering the house at address 192.168.1.10, door 80, which is usually for HTTP (web traffic).

If you go to 192.168.1.10:22 â†’ same house, but now you enter through door 22, which is usually for SSH (remote login).

ðŸ‘‰ Important points:

A port can only be used by one application at a time. For example, if one web server is already listening on port 8000, another canâ€™t use the same port on that machine unless the first one is stopped.

Different applications use different ports to separate traffic (like workstations handling different tasks).

Some ports are well-known:

80 â†’ HTTP

443 â†’ HTTPS

22 â†’ SSH

25 â†’ SMTP (email)

So in our case, when you run FastAPI with uvicorn main:app --reload, it starts listening on port 8000 by default. Thatâ€™s why you open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in the browser to talk to your API.
